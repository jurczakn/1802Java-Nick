# Spring BOOT
* Spring Boot is a Spring project that takes the approach of Convention over Configuration. It makes it easy to create standalone Spring-based applications and integrates any of the other Spring projects like Web, Security, AOP, and more.
* Spring Boot approaches projects with a biased view of the dependencies on your classpath and attempts to automatically configure those dependencies based on common usage. For instance, if your project includes “spring-boot-starter-web” dependencies, then Spring Boot will attempt to configure Spring MVC components like the DispatcherServlet, InternalViewResolver, DefaultHandlerMapper, and an embedded Tomcat servlet container.
